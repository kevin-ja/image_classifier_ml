# Sprint Project 03: FastAPI ML App

## Business Context

In today's digital landscape, companies often manage vast collections of images that require categorization for organization, search, and analytics. Manually classifying these images is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project addresses this challenge by providing an automated solution to classify images into over 1000 categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The solution is designed to streamline workflows, improve accuracy, and reduce manual labor.

## Technical Achievements

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline:**  
  The project integrates a pre-trained TensorFlow CNN model for image classification, served via a FastAPI backend.
- **Modern Web UI:**  
  A user-friendly Streamlit web interface allows users to upload images, view predictions, and provide feedback.
- **Microservices Architecture:**  
  The system is modular, with separate services for the API, model, and UI, communicating via Redis.
- **Containerization:**  
  All components are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment and reproducibility.
- **Testing & Quality:**  
  Automated unit and integration tests are provided for all major components. Code style is enforced using Black and isort.
- **Scalability & Extensibility:**  
  The architecture supports scaling and can be extended to other classification tasks or models.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ (for running tests outside containers)
- (Optional) VS Code or another IDE

### 1. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd sprint_03_ml_api
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file:

```powershell
cp .env.original .env
```

Create a shared Docker network (if not already created):

```powershell
docker network create shared_network
```

### 3. Build and Start All Services

```powershell
docker-compose up --build -d
```

To stop the services:

```powershell
docker-compose down
```

### 4. Access the Services

- **FastAPI Docs:**  
  [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)  
  Login with:  
  - user: `admin@example.com`  
  - password: `admin`

- **Web UI:**  
  [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)  
  Login with:  
  - user: `admin@example.com`  
  - password: `admin`

### 5. Running Tests

#### API Tests

```powershell
cd api
docker build -t fastapi_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

#### Model Tests

```powershell
cd model
docker build -t model_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

#### UI Tests

```powershell
cd ui
docker build -t ui_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

#### Integration Tests

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Run integration tests from the project root:

```powershell
python tests/test_integration.py
```

### 6. Code Style

To format code:

```powershell
isort --profile=black . ; black --line-length 88 .
```
